## ✅ Description

A web application that allows a user to create authentication and login to the website with their authenticated credentials. After becoming an authorized user, a user can create a user profile and add their allergies. Once their user profile and allergies have been added our application will match users with other users with complimentary/similar allergies for dating purposes. The application has full crud functionality for authenticated users. Non-authenticated users can interact with the site and see the full list of allergies.
